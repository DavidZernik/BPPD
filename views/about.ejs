  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  <b style="color:#18BC9C">stratus</b> is a mobile-optimized application that
  provides users a free and unencumbered musical streaming experience. Powered
  by the vast, open soundcloud.com api, it combines the song-saving benefits of
  paid services, with the discovery features of a free ones.
  </p>
  <p>
  We choose the name <b style="color:#18BC9C">stratus</b> as a representation of
  the service the app provides. Stratus clouds are low level cloud systems, and
  the word stratus origanates from the Latin prefix "strato", meaning "layer".
  We built our application as a tasty layer of usability on top of the powerful
  soundcloud database.
  </p>
  <p>
  From the home page, users enter simple search terms and are able to save
  individual song results to their profile, as well as create a radio station
  based on the current song that is playing.
